# Minimal-UART-CPU-FLASH-Edition
This is the latest FLASH Edition of my Minimal UART Computer design. I will be adding software tools like assembler, rom images and demo programs very soon here. Besides running TETRIS this little CPU is now capable of parsing arbitrary mathmatical expressions and performing floating point calculations in single (32-bit) precision. Watch my upcoming YouTube videos about it.

Have fun :-)
